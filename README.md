# Thinkful Hot or Cold app

Game created as part of the [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) Front-end Web Development course.

In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess – “hot” if their guess was close, and “cold” if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they’ll have the option to start a new game.
